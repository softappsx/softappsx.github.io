        <h1>General Privacy Policy of Facial Data and Our Application</h1>

       <p>

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information and customized user data. We strive to make our policy clear and understandable. If you do not agree to the terms below, we cannot provide you with our services.

            </p>

        <h2>1.⁠ ⁠Collection </h2>

          <p>
We only collect face data when you use the "AI Muscular Video Generate" features. This service uses a neural network model such as "Stable Diffusion" to generate videos based on your input. To enable this functionality, you will be asked to upload photos or selfies for the creation of the video.
</p>

        
 <h2> 2.⁠ ⁠Input Data </h2>
<p>
The photos you upload will be temporarily stored on our servers. Once the Muscular Video is successfully generated, these photos will be permanently deleted from our servers.
</p>

        
 <h2>3.⁠ ⁠Generated Videos </h2>
<p>
The generated videos will be downloaded from the API response and stored locally on the user device. After successful creation and download of the video, the video will be deleted from the server.
</p>

        
<h2> 4.⁠ ⁠Use, Transfer, and Sharing  </h2>

        <p>
