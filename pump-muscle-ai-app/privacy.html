        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Our app is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>Face Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            Our application collects and processes user-uploaded photos that contain face data to generate AI-enhanced muscular video representations. The face data is extracted and analyzed solely for this purpose.
        </p>

   
          <h2>
              Purpose of Face Data Usage
          </h2>
        <p>
            The collected face data is used exclusively for generating AI-enhanced videos. No other biometric analysis or facial recognition functionalities are implemented in our app.
        </p>

        <h2>
              Third-Party Sharing and Storage
          </h2>
        <p>
            The uploaded photos and face data are processed using the Pixverse.ai API. The data is stored on Pixverse.ai servers and is not shared with any third parties beyond this service provider.
        </p>
        
          <h2>
              Data Retention Policy
          </h2>
        <p>
            The uploaded images and generated videos are retained indefinitely on Pixverse.ai servers. Users do not have the option to delete their uploaded photos or generated content. We will not keep your personal data for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this Statement, unless an extension of the retention period is required or permitted by law.

          <h2>
              Summary
          </h2>
        <p>
            
"Our application collects user-uploaded photos containing face data to generate AI-enhanced videos. The photos are processed via Pixverse.ai and stored on their servers. Users acknowledge that uploaded images and generated content cannot be deleted. We do not use face data for any other purposes or share it with unauthorized third parties."
Our application collects user-uploaded photos that may contain face data. The collected data includes facial features necessary to generate an AI-enhanced muscular video representation of the user. No additional biometric markers or facial recognition data (such as depth maps, facial landmarks, or unique identifiers) are extracted or stored.
The facial data collected is used solely to create an AI-powered muscular video representation of the user. The uploaded photo is securely processed through the Pixverse.ai API, where AI models analyze facial features to create a transformed video. The facial data is not used for identification, authentication, or any other purpose beyond creating the requested video. Additionally, no other biometric or facial recognition is performed in our app.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy periodically. Any changes will be posted within the app, and you are encouraged to review it regularly.</p>
