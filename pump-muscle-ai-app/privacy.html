        <h1>General Privacy Policy of Facial Data and Our Application</h1>

       <p>

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information and customized user data. We strive to make our policy clear and understandable. If you do not agree to the terms below, we cannot provide you with our services.
Storage, Retention and Deletion

1.⁠ ⁠Collection

We only collect face data when you use the "AI Muscular Video Generate" features. This service uses a neural network model such as "Stable Diffusion" to generate videos based on your input. To enable this functionality, you will be asked to upload photos or selfies for the creation of the avatar.

2.⁠ ⁠Input Data

The photos you upload will be temporarily stored on our servers. Once the Muscular Video is successfully generated, these photos will be permanently deleted from our servers.

3.⁠ ⁠Created Avatars

The generated videos will be downloaded from the API response and stored locally on the user device. After successful creation and download of the avatar, the video will be deleted from the server.

4.⁠ ⁠Use, Transfer, and Sharing

- Use: We use your Face Data only to provide the "AI Muscular Video Generate" features.
- Training: We do not use your Face Data to train any other AI products.
- Identification and Marketing: We do not use your Face Data to identify individual users, for marketing purposes, or to create user profiles. We do not encourage, facilitate, or permit third parties to do so.
- Transfer and Sharing: We do not transfer, share, sell, or provide your Face Data to advertising platforms, analytics providers, data brokers, information vendors, or similar parties.
